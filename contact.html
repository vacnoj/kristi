			<p>My name is Kristi Vaninger. I graduated high school from Chatfield Senior High School. At Chatfield I played soccer, basketball, and volleyball. I earned 1st team all conference in basketball and soccer, and 2nd team all conference in volleyball. Before high school I was also a state swimmer and a national jump roper. I went on to Western State Colorado University to get my degree in Exercise and Sport Science with an emphasis in K-12 Education. I got my minor in psychology, and everything needed to have gotten a minor in sports psychology as well (you cannot, however get a Sports Psychology minor if you have Exercise and Sport Science as your major). At Western I played NCAA Division II Women’s Basketball and Club Women’s Soccer. Sports and fitness have been my passion ever since I was a little girl, as well as I love the opportunity to teach and help others. I knew that when I grew up I wanted to be a physical education teacher and a coach as long as I can remember. I currently coach high school girls basketball at Chatfield Senior High School and love it! I have finished my year long student teaching internship, teaching a semester at Governor's Ranch Elementary School, and a semester at Chatfield Senior High School. I am a Jeffco kid since day one; going to school at Ute Meadows Elementary, Deer Creek Middle, and Chatfield Senior High, as well as both of my parents are teachers in Jeffco! I would love the opportunity to continue my life in Jeffco as a physical education teacher!!!!!
