					<p> My philosophy of physical education is pretty simple. I don’t think that kids should be graded on their ability to do something in the class, but instead how hard they work, and how much they have improved from where they were in the beginning. I believe that physical education is essential, but should be fun. I think that kids should learn things that they will be able to take with them the rest of their lives. I believe that the students should have optimal play time, making sure that they are getting enough movement in. Sometimes we can look at physical activity and exercise as something we have to do even though we don’t like it. I want to instead make it fun and something that students will get excited about doing as well as something that they are excited to take home with them and teach their friends and family.  Students will not only learn physical activity, but also other important things such as nutrition. I believe that physical education should also teach them things like responsibility, problem solving skills, and social interaction, as these are things that they will use moving forward in their lives.</p>

			<p>My name is Kristi Vaninger. I graduated high school from Chatfield Senior High School. At Chatfield I played soccer, basketball, and volleyball. I earned 1st team all conference in basketball and soccer, and 2nd team all conference in volleyball. Before high school I was also a state swimmer and a national jump roper. I went on to Western State Colorado University to get my degree in Exercise and Sport Science with an emphasis in K-12 Education. I got my minor in psychology, and everything needed to have gotten a minor in sports psychology as well (you cannot, however get a Sports Psychology minor if you have Exercise and Sport Science as your major). At Western I played NCAA Division II Women’s Basketball and Club Women’s Soccer. Sports and fitness have been my passion ever since I was a little girl, as well as I love the opportunity to teach and help others. I knew that when I grew up I wanted to be a physical education teacher and a coach as long as I can remember. I currently coach high school girls basketball at Chatfield Senior High School and love it! I have finished my year long student teaching internship, teaching a semester at Governor's Ranch Elementary School, and a semester at Chatfield Senior High School. I am a Jeffco kid since day one; going to school at Ute Meadows Elementary, Deer Creek Middle, and Chatfield Senior High, as well as both of my parents are teachers in Jeffco! I would love the opportunity to continue my life in Jeffco as a physical education teacher!!!!!
