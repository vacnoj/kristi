					<p> My philosophy of physical education is pretty simple. I don’t think that kids should be graded on their ability to do something in the class, but instead how hard they work, and how much they have improved from where they were in the beginning. I believe that physical education is essential, but should be fun. I think that kids should learn things that they will be able to take with them the rest of their lives. I believe that the students should have optimal play time, making sure that they are getting enough movement in. Sometimes we can look at physical activity and exercise as something we have to do even though we don’t like it. I want to instead make it fun and something that students will get excited about doing as well as something that they are excited to take home with them and teach their friends and family.  Students will not only learn physical activity, but also other important things such as nutrition. I believe that physical education should also teach them things like responsibility, problem solving skills, and social interaction, as these are things that they will use moving forward in their lives.</p>
